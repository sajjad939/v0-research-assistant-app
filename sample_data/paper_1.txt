Abstract: This paper presents novel deep learning architectures for natural language understanding tasks. We evaluate on three major benchmarks: GLUE, SuperGLUE, and MNLI. Results show 3-5% improvement over baseline methods.

Methods: We employ transformer-based models with attention mechanisms. Dataset: 500K labeled examples from diverse sources. Metrics: Accuracy, F1 score, Matthews correlation coefficient.

Results: Our model achieves 92.3% accuracy on GLUE benchmark, with F1 scores of 0.891 on NLI task. Ablation studies confirm importance of multi-head attention mechanisms. Comparison with BERT shows improvements particularly on long-context understanding tasks.

Conclusions: Multi-agent attention provides substantial gains for NLU tasks. Future work includes scaling to 10B+ parameters and evaluation on code understanding benchmarks.
